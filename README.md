# Challenge-1-Start-Here-
Creation of a program that wil take user input and produce a sentence using that information.

Sgt McQuillan's first Programming Challenge.

Requirements:

  Users should be able to enter Name, Age, and Github Username.
  
  Program should return a statement with the format of:
  
  "Your name is [Name], you are [Age] years oled, and your Github Username is [GitHub Username}."
  
Guidelines:

  You may use any language you want. (I suggest VBScript or Powershell.) 
  
  Error handling is nice, but not necessary.
  
  Good Luck!!
